So…\\nHow are the techniques used in data, business\\nintelligence, or predictive analytics applied\\nin real life?\\nCertainly, with the help of computers.\\nYou can basically split the relevant tools\\ninto two categories—programming languages\\nand software.\\nKnowing a programming language enables you\\nto devise programs that can execute specific\\noperations.

Due to the similarity of the words, some people believe they share the same meaning, and thus use them interchangeably. Technically, this isn’t correct. There is, in fact, a distinct difference between the two. And the reason for one often being used instead of the other is the lack of a transparent understanding of both'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='So, let’s clear this up, shall we? First, we will start with analysis. Consider the following… You have a huge dataset containing data of various types. Instead of tackling the entire dataset and running the risk of becoming overwhelmed, you separate it into easier to digest chunks and study them individually and examine how they relate to other parts. And that’s analysis in a nutshell'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='And that’s analysis in a nutshell. One important thing to remember, however, is that you perform analyses on things that have already happened in the past. Such as using an analysis to explain how a story ended the way it did or how there was a decrease in sales last summer. All this means that we do analyses to explain how and/or why something happened. Great! Now, this leads us nicely on to the definition of analytics. As you have probably guessed, analytics generally refers to the future'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Instead of explaining past events it explores potential future ones. Analytics is essentially the application of logical and computational reasoning to the component parts obtained in an analysis. And in doing this you are looking for patterns and exploring what you could do with them in the future. Here, analytics branches off into two areas: qualitative analytics – this is using your intuition and experience in conjunction with the analysis to plan your next business move'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"And quantitative analytics – this is applying formulas and algorithms to numbers you have gathered from your analysis. Here are a couple of examples.
