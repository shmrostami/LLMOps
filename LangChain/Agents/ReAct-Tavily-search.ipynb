Agentic AI is an intelligent system that can act autonomously, reason through multi-step problems, and adapt its actions in real-time to achieve a specific business goal with minimal human supervision. This platform includes a suite of tools and services to help AI agents learn, adapt, and collaborate to efficiently handle complex, dynamic tasks. With this framework, businesses can customize AI agents to meet specific needs, whether those needs involve automating repetitive tasks, enhancing customer service, or driving strategic decision-making. ### What agentic AI is. ### What agentic AI is not. By automating complex, multi-step tasks and making decisions independently, AI agents significantly speed up operational processes. With real-time decision-making and continuous learning, AI agents complete tasks faster and with higher accuracy, boosting overall employee and team efficiency. ### What is agentic AI?

Agentic AI combines multiple types of artificial intelligence to enable thinking, acting, and adapting: large language models (LLMs) for reasoning and communication; planning AI for task sequencing; reinforcement learning for optimizing actions; and memory systems for context retention. Moreover, LLMs have enabled agentic AI to reason and make decisions based on the information they process. Breaking down data silos and connecting disparate systems gives agentic AI a 360-degree view of your business, enabling it to make smarter, data-driven decisions and automate complex workflows. Additionally, sophisticated data processing tools enable businesses to extract valuable insights from massive datasets in real-time, fueling the decision making capabilities of agentic AI. Agentic AI, in short, is enabling us to explore entirely new possibilities in designing work processes, expanding the role of automation as we redefine the roles of people, robots, and machines in a myriad of processes across the organization. ##### What are AI agents?', 'score': 0.92074, 'raw_content': None}, {'url': 'https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/', 'title': 'What Is Agentic AI?', 'content': '# What Is Agentic AI? *Agentic AI uses sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to solve complex, multi-step problems.*.
